# monero.c#

> C# port for monero

This is not a ready-to-use package (as opposed to monero.dart and monero.ts), but it works. You can check the `monero_wrapper.cs`.

Currently C# code is optimized to be used in Godot.., if you are not planning to use it there - simply do not extend Node class and remove Godot import, if you are planning to use it in production, please let me know - we can work on a better approach to using monero with proper package code in here.
